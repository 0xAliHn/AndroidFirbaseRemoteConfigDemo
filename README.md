Remote config is a feature of Firebase suite that allows us to alter both the look and feel of our application without the need to publish any updates to the Google Play or App store. This works by allowing us to define in-app parameters that can be overridden from within the firebase console — these parameters can then be activated for either all or a defined selection of users.
